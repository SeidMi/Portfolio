> *I am a Business Economist specialized in Business Informatics and currently expanding my skills in Data Analytics. What fascinates me most is how data can reveal complex connections and provide a clear foundation for well-informed decisions.
I bring experience in leadership, communication, and process optimization, and have developed Access databases and SQL queries to improve workflows. My goal is to combine this experience with strong technical skills to help organizations drive data-driven decisions and sustainable improvements.*
